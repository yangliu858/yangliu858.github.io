I received my Ph.D. in 2015 from the Ohio State University, Columbus under the
  supervision of [Henri
  Moscovici](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=11648).
  Currently, I am a  postdoctoral fellow in the [Geometry and Mathematical Physics][gmphsissa] group, 
  at SISSA, Trieste.

Research Interests
======
I study noncommutative geometry developed by [Alain Connes][conneshp] and many other mathematicians around the 80's, with applications in differential geometry and topology. The basic tools include K-theory, cyclic cohomology, Morita equivalence, operator-theoretic index theorems and Hopf algebra symmetry. 
Global analysis, especially tools like  pseudo-differential calculus for
studying heat kernel expansions, is heavily involved in my current research.

Positions
======
- Sep. 2016 - Dec. 2018,  Postdoctoral fellow at MPIM, Bonn
- Jan. 2019 - Apr. 2019, Riemann fellow at Riemann Center for Geometry and Physics (Leibniz University), Hannover
